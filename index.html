        <h2> TODO: </h2>
        <h3> Week of 9/13 </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> JavaScript Tutorial (not sure on which one I want to do, will probably be one from the portfolio description) </li>
            <li> Probably one of <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4">these</a> as my artifact. I'm also planning to use VSCode and Github to push this project to the repo. </li>
            <li> TypeScript Tutorial (probably <a href = "https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-typescript/lessons/introduction-to-typescript/exercises/from-javascript-to-typescript">this one</a>)</li>
            <li> React if I'm doing well on time </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Week of 9/20 </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Right now the Pokemon application only takes in input and then displays the pokemon's picture, but I intend to build on the site to mimic a team building application. I plan to include 6 of these cards, and then when the input is given, it will assign a pokemon to one of the six cards. There'll also be an option to remove a card, and I hope to be able to add fields that can let you choose moves as well. </li>
            <li> I plan to integrate bootstrap onto my portfolio so that it looks nicer </li>
            <li> Since I'm building an application, I think I'm going to look into user interface design as well</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Week of 9/27 </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I want to add features to the pokemon website, probably some from the project board</li>
            <li>I'll learn testing and then use those to add tests to the pokemon website</li>
            <li>I'll learn requirements gathering, but I'm not sure how I'd show mastery for this. I was thinking maybe I go through the process for one of the websites additional features?</li>
            <li>Hopefully this week I'll finally have time to update the website's CSS</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Changelog </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Week of 9/6: Added email, changelog, todo and completed the HTML and CSS sections   </li>
                <li> Week of 9/13: I completed the TypeScript tutorial for CodeCademy. I have created a small website using TypeScript and React, as well as Bootstrap for formatting. <a href = "https://izahe.github.io/pokedex/">The link can be found here</a>.  The site fetches data from a public API source called PokeAPI, then ports the pokemon's sprite and name onto a card.</li>
                <li>Week of 9/20: Updated UI Design, and CSS mastery row. The pokemon website has been updated. </li>
                <ol>
                   <li>When there are no pokemon that have been entered, text is displayed that asks the user to input.</li>
                   <li>The amount of pokemon you can enter has been increased to 6. If you try to enter over 6 the website will prompt you saying that 6 is the maximum</li>
                   <li>Pokemon can now be deleted by clicking the red x button</li>
                   <li>The user interface was updated to make using the app a little more intuitive, The search bar is bigger and the repository and pokeapi links are less bright</li>
                   <li>The website's repository is now utilizing Github's Project Board and Issues pages (the link to the repository is on the pokemon website)</li>
                </ol>
                <li>More updates to the pokemon website:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li> Fixed the websites title</li>
                    <li> Added a button that when clicked, deletes every current pokemon on the team</li>
                    <li> Added a button that when clicked, prompts you to enter a name, then saves the pokemon team with that name under the "Saved Teams" list. When clicking on one of the names, it will load the pokemon team that was saved</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
