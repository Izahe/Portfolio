            <h3> Week of 9/15 </h3>
            <li> JavaScript Tutorial (not sure on which one I want to do, will probably be one from the portfolio description) </li>
            <li> Probably one of <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4">these</a> as my artifact. I'm also planning to use VSCode and Github to push this project to the repo. </li>
            <li> TypeScript Tutorial (probably <a href = "https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-typescript/lessons/introduction-to-typescript/exercises/from-javascript-to-typescript">this one</a>)</li>
            <li> React if I'm doing well on time </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h3> Week of 9/20 </h3>
            <li> Right now the Pokemon application only takes in input and then displays the pokemon's picture, but I intend to build on the site to mimic a team building application. I plan to include 6 of these cards, and then when the input is given, it will assign a pokemon to one of the six cards. There'll also be an option to remove a card, and I hope to be able to add fields that can let you choose moves as well. </li>
            <li> I plan to integrate bootstrap onto my portfolio so that it looks nicer </li>
            <li> Since I'm building an application, I think I'm going to look into user interface design as well</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Changelog </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Week of 9/6: Added email, changelog, todo and completed the HTML and CSS sections   </li>
                 <li> Week of 9/15: I have created a small website using TypeScript and React, as well as Bootstrap for formatting. <a href = "https://izahe.github.io/pokedex/">The link can be found here</a>  The site fetches data from a public API source called PokeAPI, then ports the pokemon's sprite and name onto a card.</li>
